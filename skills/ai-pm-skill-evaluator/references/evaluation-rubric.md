# Evaluation Rubric

Use behavior-based evidence. Mark each dimension **pass**, **partial**, **fail**, or **not tested**. Do not total the labels into a score unless the user supplies weights and thresholds.

| Dimension | Pass | Partial | Fail |
|---|---|---|---|
| Activation | Intended requests activate; nearby out-of-scope requests do not | One ambiguous or inconsistent trigger | Repeated false activation or failure to activate on a clear intended request |
| Routing | Chooses the correct workflow and asks for missing decision-critical inputs | Correct broad route but misses a branch or needed clarification | Chooses an incompatible workflow or proceeds on an unsupported assumption |
| Process | Follows the stated sequence, preserves confirmation gates, and handles failure states | Minor step omitted without affecting the decision or user control | Skips a required gate, fabricates completion, or loses required state |
| Evidence | Claims trace to provided/retrieved evidence; uncertainty is explicit | Evidence exists but is incomplete or weakly connected to claims | Material claims are unsupported, invented, or misrepresented as verified |
| Deliverable | Meets the agreed output format and acceptance criteria | Useful but needs a bounded correction | Missing, unusable, or materially inconsistent with the requested deliverable |
| Reliability | Similar cases behave consistently; revisions fix the target failure without regression | One unexplained variance or untested regression risk | Repeatedly unstable behavior or a revision breaks core cases |

## Severity

- **Critical**: violates user control, exposes sensitive data, invents evidence, or invalidates the main decision.
- **Major**: breaks a core workflow, routes common requests incorrectly, or produces an unusable deliverable.
- **Minor**: wording, formatting, or edge-case weakness with a clear workaround.

Critical findings are blockers regardless of other passing dimensions. State severity and evidence separately; do not hide a blocker in an average.

## Evidence record

For every finding, record:

- case ID and exact prompt;
- Skill version and whether the Skill was loaded;
- relevant output excerpt or artifact;
- expected behavior and the source of that expectation;
- pass/fail status and severity;
- whether the cause is observed or only suspected.
